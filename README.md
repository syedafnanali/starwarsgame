# STAR WARS GAME
## How do I play the game ?
- click on the button that says 'click to begin'
- choose your fighter from the list
- choose a deffender to fight against from the enemy list
- click the attack your enemy button.
------------
## But how does it work?
Each time you hit the attack button your fighter and the enemy will get their health points
decremented by amount 
- For your fighter his health points will be decremented by how much the enemy has in his 
  counter attack power
- The enemy health points will be decremented by your fighter attack power and the attack
  power will be incremented each time you attack by the amount of your fighter base attack
  power let's say your attack power is 6 when you attack for the first time the enemy health
  points will be decremented by 6 but the next time you attack the enemy health points will be
  decremented by 12 the third time your fighter's attack power will be 18 and so on.
- If you finished all the enemies in the list that's mean you won.
- if your health points hit the zero or below that's mean you lost.
-------------

- using javascript/jquery for the logic.
